# My Portfolio

## Why and how?

When I'm learning new technologies, I really like to practice to be sure I did understand well what I'm learning.
So I challenged my friends to learn a new Front-End techno too and to make their own portfolio! We have approximately one month starting from the 15/16/2020 to make our little website and push it on a PaaS to host it.

# Technologies behind

I'm learning VueJS since a few months and now I want to go deeper in my learning.
I chose to go with NuxtJS!
